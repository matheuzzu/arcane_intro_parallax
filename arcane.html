    Look out for yourself
    
    [Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]<br>
    I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
    For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground<br>
    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
    When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
    
    [Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]<br>
    Tell you you're the greatest<br>
    But once you turn, they hate us<br>

        [Chorus: Dan Reynolds]<br>
        Oh, the misery<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        But I'm ready<br>

    <p>
        [Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]<br>
        Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall<br>
        And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've <br>been called<br>
        I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time<br>
        When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]<br>
        Tell you you're the greatest<br>
        But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)<br>

        [Verse 3: JID]<br>
        I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me<br>
        I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me<br>
        I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted<br>
        Being a wreck of emotions<br>
        Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
        The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
        The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
        I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"<br>
        They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
        I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut<br>
        I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
        And it matters more because I had it not<br>
        Had I thought about wreaking havoc<br>
        On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static<br>
        With precision, I'm automatic quarterback<br>
        I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it<br>
        Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up<br>
        Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we is just-<br>
        [Chorus: Dan Reynolds]<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy (Ah)<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Oh, the misery (Ah)<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy (Ah)<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>

        [Outro: Dan Reynolds]<br>
        Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way<br>
        My enemy<br>
        Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint<br>
